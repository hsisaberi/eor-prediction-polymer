# Artificial Neural Network to Forecast Enhanced Oil Recovery Using Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide in Sandstone and Carbonate Reservoirs

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the model discussed in the research paper [Artificial Neural Network to Forecast Enhanced Oil Recovery Using Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide in Sandstone and Carbonate Reservoirs](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/13/16/2606). The model utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) performance in sandstone and carbonate reservoirs using Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide.

## üìö **Overview**
Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) using polymers such as Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide (HPAM) is a widely studied method to improve oil extraction from reservoirs. This MATLAB-based ANN model forecasts EOR efficiency based on key reservoir and operational parameters, including polymer concentration, salt concentration, rock type, initial oil saturation, porosity, permeability, pore volume flooding, temperature, API gravity, molecular weight of the polymer, and salinity.
